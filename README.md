# Stanford CS109: Probability for Computer Scientists

**Problem Set #1 â€“ Fall 2021**

This repository contains my personal solutions to **CS109 â€“ Probability for Computer Scientists** (Fall 2021). **Please note: I am not a Stanford University student, and these solutions are provided solely as a learning reference without any guarantee of accuracy.**

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

CS109 is a publicly available Stanford course on probability theory, and all lecture videos and materials can be freely accessed online. However, the official course does not provide problem sets or their solutions.

Since the problem sets from the Fall 2021 term were publicly posted on the course website, I have compiled and shared them here along with my own solutions. The purpose is to help other learners who are studying probability theory independently.

**Please do not use any content from this repository as submissions for your own coursework or for any form of academic dishonesty.**

I sincerely hope that others will contribute by reviewing, correcting, or improving these solutions. If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for clearer explanations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## âœ¨ Disclaimer

- All solutions here are **personal study notes** and **do not represent official answers**.
- Content is provided for educational and reference purposes only.
- If you are currently enrolled in a similar course, **do not copy these solutions**.
